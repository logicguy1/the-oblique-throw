## What is the project about?

When we throw a ball (ignoreing wind resistance) when the ball leaves our hand we know the only accselaration acting upon the ball is the gravatational constant. 

## The simulations

For the simulations i used the following equations to get the distance that the ball travelled

Using this I wrote the following python code to simulate the throws

```{python functionDefiniton}
import math
import sympy

def calc_dist(v, a, h = 10):
    """
    Take in an velocety, angle and a height and calculate the distance it will travel
    """
    g = 9.82 # Gravatational constant
    x = sympy.Symbol('x')
    
    # Left side of the equatoin
    c1 = -1 * h
    
    # Right side of the equation
    c2 = v * math.sin(math.radians(a)) * x - 1/2 * g * x**2 
    
    # Solve it, we can discard the negative solution
    t = max(sympy.solve(sympy.Eq(c1, c2), (x,)))
    s = v * math.cos(math.radians(a)) * t
    
    return s

```

Here is an example

```{python simulations}
print(calc_dist(15, 10), # Velocety: 15 m/s, angle: 10 degree
      calc_dist(20, 15), # Velocety: 20 m/s, angle: 15 degree
      calc_dist(5, 25)) # Velocety: 5 m/s, angle: 25 degree
```

I wrote a script to run this 22860 times but i wont go over that in this document, its linked as `main.py`

## Visualising the data

Lets first take at what type of data we are working with here 

```{r summary}
summary(data)
```
From taking a look at the summary we can see that the higest distance we reached was 272 meters with an avrige of 66

```{r str}
str(data)
```
From the str function we get a preview of our data and we find that we have 22860 datapoints

Why not try and plot it?

```{r plot1, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = data, aes(x = vel, y = ang, color = dist)) +
  geom_point() + # The way the plot should look
  scale_colour_gradientn(colours = rainbow(6)) +
  labs(title = "The distance traveled corrosponding to angle and velocety",
       x = "Velocety at launch [m/s]",
       y = "Angle [degrees]"
  )

```

Now what can we do with this data?

Lets try to isolate a range of distances and with this range we can also try to use a regression

Here i got all the datapoints with a dist value between 99 and 100m

```{r plot2, echo=FALSE}
subs <- subset(data, dist <= 100 & dist >= 99) # Get the higest point
ggplot(data = subs, aes(x = ang, y = vel)) +
  geom_point() + # The way the plot should look
  labs(title = "A slice of the above heatmap",
       y = "Velocety at launch [m/s]",
       x = "Angle [degrees]"
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, formula = y ~ poly(x, 2))
```

From that parabalae we find the fomula to be `f(x) = 0.01369*xÂ²-1.14801*x+52.91235` with a r^2^ value of 0.975, so quite a nice fit

My theroy is that we can calculate the top of the parabulae and find the optimal angle for all velocties when the height is 10

```{r}
a <- 0.01369 # To get the point we are looking for we only need the a and b constants
b <- -1.14801

print((-1*b)/(2*a)) # -b/2a
```

So the optimal angle for the oblique throw when the height is 10m would be 41.93 degree
